## Overview of Structure Journalism

In recent years, the internet is overloaded with tons and tons of information and news articles. So, a reader can get news on-demand basis. Readers are interested to get enough information with short and crisp stories instead of large and big chunks of information. This became a major constraint for a journalist to produce short stories to grab the reader's attention without affecting the fact. Here the Structure journalism comes into the picture, journalist only requires a background story to create a new story but not the readers. A journalist can hide the background story for the readers by default and can provide only the current facts/information. This provides enough information to the readers in a go. If a reader is interested in the background story, he/she can grasp more information by browsing on that topic.

## How structured journalism helps journalist\?

In structured journalism, stories are broken into numerous smaller data that can provide information/facts independently. Those smaller pieces of data can be stored, and re-used by any other journalists to create new stories to provide enough information to the readers on the current trends.
