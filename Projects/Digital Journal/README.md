### Overview

The digital journal is all about providing numerous templates for journalists on various background stories to start with the news articles to be published. Similarly, the journalist would be alerted on abnormal incidents based on the previous records of any scenarios. For instance, if a sudden rise in COVID cases is noticed in a region, the same will be highlighted to journalists through the notification and provides more relevant information. A journalist can view and check for more information and it eventually leads to the creation of news articles.
